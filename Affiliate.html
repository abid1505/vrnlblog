                            <h6>💡 VRNL’s Revenue Model/Share</h6>
                            <p>The VRNL affiliate program operates on a revenue-sharing model, allowing affiliates to
                                earn a share of the profits generated by the players they refer. Unlike many programs
                                with fixed or short-term payouts, VRNL offers lifetime commissions—so you continue
                                earning even if you're no longer actively promoting.</p>
                            <p>While the commission percentage isn't fixed at 50%, it can be customized based on your
                                agreement with your affiliate manager, providing flexibility and a chance to earn high
                                returns depending on your performance and promotional efforts.</p>
                            <p>This model makes VRNL an ideal long-term income opportunity, rewarding affiliates for the
                                traffic and loyal users they bring to the platform.
                            </p>

                                    <p>Yes, many high-ticket affiliate programs are 100% legitimate. Trusted platforms
                                        like ClickFunnels, Bluehost, and Teachable offer real commissions and provide
                                        transparent dashboards and regular payouts. Always verify the program’s
                                        reputation before joining.

                                    <p>Absolutely. Beginners can start with one high-paying product, create
                                        niche-specific content (blogs, YouTube, TikTok), and use SEO or social media to
                                        drive traffic. Success depends on consistency, trust-building, and audience
